            <p>Witness the untainted beauty of Leyte’s virgin paradise, Kalanggaman Island. This private day trip is perfect for nature lovers who are looking for a unique beach destination.

This stunning island is now one of the top beach destinations in the Philippines because of its turquoise blue waters and long sandbars from both sides of the island.</p>
            <p>The Island is said to be a smaller version of Boracay. What sets it apart from other beaches are its charming sandbars and the lack of crowds. The island is an ideal place to lounge around or take a dip in the water. You can also rent kayaks and paddleboards. </p>
